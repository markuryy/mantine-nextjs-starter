# New Project

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app), using [Mantine](https://mantine.dev/) for UI components and styling.

## Features

- Next.js 13 with App Router
- Mantine UI components
- TypeScript
- Responsive layout with AppShell
- Documentation page

## Getting Started

First, install dependencies and run the development server:

```bash
bun i
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Project Structure

- `src/app`: Contains the main application pages and layouts
- `src/components`: Reusable React components
- `src/data`: JSON data files
- `public`: Static assets

## Available Pages

- Home: `/`
- Documentation: `/docs`
- Settings: `/settings` (to be implemented)

## Customization

You can start editing the page by modifying `src/app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

To customize the Mantine theme, edit the `theme` object in `src/app/layout.tsx`.
